# Library-Management 
In this Project a library database is created in which multiple tables are created like authors,books,book_copies,library_branch,
publisher,borrower,book_copies and book_loans.
The tables are created in specific order keeping in mind the primary keys and foreign keys.
Various Queries are performed like
1. How many copies of the book titled "The Lost Tribe" are owned by the library
branch whose name is "Sharpstown"?
2. How many copies of the book titled "The Lost Tribe" are owned by each library
branch?
3. Retrieve the names of all borrowers who do not have any books checked out.
4. For each book that is loaned out from the "Sharpstown" branch and whose
DueDate is 2/3/18, retrieve the book title, the borrower's name, and the
borrower's address.
5. For each library branch, retrieve the branch name and the total number of books
loaned out from that branch.
6. Retrieve the names, addresses, and number of books checked out for all
borrowers who have more than five books checked out.
7. For each book authored by "Stephen King", retrieve the title and the number of
copies owned by the library branch whose name is "Central"
